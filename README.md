This project was made for CECS 328 at CSULB. It is written in Python. It takes a string spread across multiple lines in a waveform pattern and returns to the user the number of 1's and 0's.

A .txt file is provided with example test cases and expected outputs. The user can copy these directly into the program or use them as a baseline to write their own.
